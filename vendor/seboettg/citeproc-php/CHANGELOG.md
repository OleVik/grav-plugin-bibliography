# CHANGELOG

## 2.1.3 - 2018-06-15

* bugfix for issue [50](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php/issues/50): In some cases punctuation in quote did not work.

## 2.1.2 - 2018-04-18

* bugfix for issue [49](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php/issues/49): Stylesheets that used the ``text-case="title"`` option, in combination with some in Slavic (or Serbo-Croatian) language, caused errors that destroyed the entire output. This was caused by the capitalization of non-letter characters.

## 2.1.1 - 2018-02-08
* Support for render variables that are using "-short" suffixes, if Text tags have a "form" attribute which is set to "short": ``<text form="short" .../>``. This is used e.g. for abbreviated journal title (container-title-short) and occurred a wrong output in different styles (for example AMA American Medical Association) in previous citeproc-php versions. Have a look at issue [47](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php/issues/47).

## 2.1.0 - 2017-11-23

* possibility to filter specific citations independently from CSL input data (inspired by @CarlosCraviotto PR #39). Have a look [here](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php/blob/master/README.md#filter-citations).
* possibility to use custom Lambda functions to enrich bibliographies and citations with additional HTML markup. Have a look [here](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php/blob/master/README.md#advanced-usage-of-citeproc-php).
